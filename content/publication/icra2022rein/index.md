abstract: With the development of sensing and communication technologies in
  networked cyber-physical systems (CPSs), multi-agent reinforcement learning
  (MARL)-based methodologies are integrated into the control process of physical
  systems and demonstrate prominent performance in a wide array of CPS domains,
  such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, it remains challenging
  to mathematically characterize the improvement of the performance of CAVs with
  communication and cooperation capability. When each individual autonomous
  vehicle is originally self-interest, we can not assume that all agents would
  cooperate naturally during the training process. In this work, we propose to
  reallocate the system’s total reward efﬁciently to motivate stable cooperation
  among autonomous vehicles. We formally deﬁne and quantify how to reallocate
  the system’s total reward to each agent under the proposed transferable
  utility game, such that communicationbased cooperation among multi-agents
  increases the system’s total reward. We prove that Shapley value-based reward
  reallocation of MARL locates in the core if the transferable utility game is a
  convex game. Hence, the cooperation is stable and efﬁcient and the agents
  should stay in the coalition or the cooperating group. We then propose a
  cooperative policy learning algorithm with Shapley value reward reallocation.
  In experiments, compared with several literature algorithms, we show the
  improvement of the mean episode system reward of CAV systems using our
  proposed algorithm.
