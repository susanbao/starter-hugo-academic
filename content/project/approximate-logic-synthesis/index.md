We researched approximate logic synthesis of electric design autonomation field. 



In terms of two-level approximate logic synthesis, we designed a novel heuristic algorithm to identify an approximate sum-of-product expression under a given error rate constraint so that it has the fewest literals. Outcomes: Through experiments with C++, we proved our algorithm is better than the previous state-of-the-art.



In terms of multi-level approximate logic synthesis, we designed a novel batch error estimation method based on Monte Carlo simulation and local change propagation to improve the performance of existing multi-level approximate logic synthesis flows. Outcomes: Through experiments with C++, under the average error magnitude, it achieves an improvement of 2.3x in area.
