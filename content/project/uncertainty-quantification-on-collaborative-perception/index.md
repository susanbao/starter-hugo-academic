We designed the uncertainty qualification algorithm for the preception of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in order to improve the performance of the later module of autonomous driving such as prediction and planning. 

Our first work is uncertainty quantification of collaborative object detction for CAVs. We propose a novel uncertainty quantification method, called Double-M Quantification, which tailors a moving block bootstrap (MBB) algorithm with direct modeling of the multivariant Gaussian distribution of each corner of the bounding box.
<strong>Outcomes</strong>: We are the first ones to do it.  Experimental results showed our algorithm achieves more than 4Ã— improvement on uncertainty score and more than 3% accuracy improvement, compared with the state-of-the-art. 

My work: Designed Algorithm, wrote code, conducted experiments, and analyzed the results with Pytorch on Python.
