We designed the uncertainty qualification algorithm for the 3D cooperative object detection of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in order to improve the performance of the later module of autonomous driving such as prediction and planning. 

Outcomes: We are the first ones to do it.  Experimental results showed our algorithm achieves more than 4Ã— improvement on uncertainty score and more than 3% accuracy improvement, compared with the state-of-the-art. 

My work: Designed Algorithm, wrote code, conducted experiments, and analyzed the results with Pytorch on Python.
