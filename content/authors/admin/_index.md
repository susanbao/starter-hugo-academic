I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Connecticut. My current research interests include uncertainty quantification, perception, deep Learning, and reinforcement learning.


I received a bachelor’s degree in automation from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2016, and a master’s degree in electronic science and technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2019. After graduation, I worked as a software engineer in Shanghai Huawei Technologies Company, China, from 2019 to 2021. I joined UConn as a Ph.D. student in computer science and engineering starting in Autumn 2021.
